AlertKit is a library for SwiftUI that enables the creation of interactive and customized alerts to enhance user experience.

## Features

- Simple implementation as Sheet or fullScreenCover
- Ð¡ustomization for every taste
- Support for haptics, gestures and animations

This library is compatible with iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.

## Installing

AlertKit uses Swift Package Manager, so you should use Xcode to add a package dependency for <https://github.com/0xYanis/AlertKit.git>.

Once that completes, import AlertKit into your Swift code wherever needed:

```swift
import AlertKit
```

## Usage

1. Similarly with `sheet` and standard alerts, create a state property of type Bool by changing which it will be possible to show/hide the alert:

```swift
@State var isPresented: Bool = false
```

2. Apply a modifier to the content of your `view`:

```swift
.alertToast("Hello, World!", isPresented: $isPresented)
```

3. If you are interested in customization, then other modifiers are also available to you; In addition to the content shown, you can also change the shape and style of the alert itself.

```swift
.alertToast(
    isPresented: $isPresented,
    timeInterval: 5,
    shape: Capsule(),
    background: Material.ultraThinMaterial,
    haptic: .warning
) {
    HStack {
        Image("Github logo")
        Text("Welcome, User!")
    }
}
```
